	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	
	<div class="left">
		Welcome to my personal website.
		As of right now, this is a work-in-progress test version, so you won't find much interesting content.
		The picture on the right was taken by me during a skate session in the summer of 2021, on one of my analogue cameras.
		Right now it merely serves as a place holder, just like this text. Bli bla blub.
